# Migrate to Prism Toolkit

## Problem
The current project uses CommunityToolkit for MVVM, which is less suited for advanced modularity, navigation, and extensibility needs (e.g., plugins, dynamic UI, multi-platform support).

## Proposal
- Migrate the project from CommunityToolkit to Prism Toolkit.
- Use Prism's advanced features (modularity, navigation, dependency injection, region management).
- Leverage Prism's strong support for MVVM, modular UI composition, and plugin architectures.

## Benefits
- **Superior Modularity:** Prism is designed for modular applications.
- **Dynamic UI:** Supports user-editable UI and runtime composition.
- **Multi-Platform Ready:** Facilitates browser/site support and alternative frontends.
- **Plugin-Friendly:** Well-suited for extensibility.


Certainly! Here's a detailed comparison between **.NET Community Toolkit** (often just called Community Toolkit) and **Prism**, focusing on their purposes, features, and when to use each.

### Comparing .NET Community Toolkit vs Prism

| Aspect                     | .NET Community Toolkit (including CommunityToolkit.MVVM)               | Prism Framework                                    |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                | A collection of helper libraries, UI controls, and MVVM utilities designed to accelerate app development, especially for WinUI/UWP, WPF, Xamarin, and .NET MAUI. Focuses on MVVM patterns, UI helpers, behaviors, and utilities. | A comprehensive application framework focused on building modular, maintainable, and testable XAML apps with full support for MVVM, dependency injection, modularity, navigation, and event aggregation. |
| **Scope**                 | Modular libraries and tools rather than a full framework. Includes MVVM toolkit, UI controls, behaviors, converters, helpers, and diagnostics tools. | Complete app framework, providing architecture and infrastructure for large-scale apps with navigation, modularity, regions, DI, and more. |
| **MVVM Support**            | Yes, through CommunityToolkit.MVVM â€” lightweight, source-generated, attribute-based. | Yes, built-in and integrated with extended patterns like ViewModelLocator. |
| **Dependency Injection (DI)** | No native DI container; intended to be used with any DI library or the built-in Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection. | Built-in DI container integration (supports popular DI containers). |
| **Navigation**              | No built-in navigation framework; navigation patterns must be implemented manually or via platform-specific APIs. | Extensive navigation abstraction for routing and deep linking. |
| **Modularity**              | No explicit support for modularity or composite applications. | Full support for modular development (modules loaded dynamically). |
| **Event Aggregation / Messaging** | Messenger class for lightweight loosely-coupled communication between ViewModels. | Advanced Event Aggregator pattern for inter-module and cross-component communication. |
| **UI Components**           | Includes WinUI controls, behaviors, converters, animations, and helpers that extend platform UI capabilities. | Does not provide UI controls; focuses on architectural patterns and infrastructure. |
| **Complexity & Learning Curve** | Lightweight and easier to adopt; ideal for small to medium projects or adding MVVM support without heavy infrastructure. | Larger learning curve but provides more features suitable for enterprise-level applications. |
| **Platform Support**        | Primarily WinUI/UWP, WPF, Xamarin.Forms, and .NET MAUI. | WPF, Xamarin.Forms, Uno Platform, .NET MAUI. |
| **Community & Maintenance**  | Official Microsoft-supported toolkit with active development and contributions. | Open source, community-driven with Microsoft roots; well-established in enterprise space. |
| **Use Cases**               | Projects needing MVVM scaffolding, helper controls, and UI utilities without full framework overhead. | Large, modular, enterprise apps requiring structured navigation, DI, and modularity support. |

### When to Use Each

#### Use **.NET Community Toolkit** if you:
- Need modern, fast, and easy MVVM support with source generators.
- Want UI helpers, behaviors, converters, and controls to speed up UI development.
- Are building small-to-medium size apps or prefer building your own app architecture.
- Want a lightweight, modular approach and prefer to pick-and-choose libraries.
- Work mainly with WinUI, but also support WPF, Xamarin.Forms, or .NET MAUI.

#### Use **Prism** if you:
- Are developing a large-scale, modular, or enterprise-grade application.
- Need a robust app framework with built-in support for dependency injection, navigation, modularity, and event aggregation.
- Want a well-defined architecture to promote maintainability and testability across teams.
- Use WPF, Xamarin.Forms, Uno Platform, or .NET MAUI and require modular app infrastructure.

### Summary

| Feature               | .NET Community Toolkit                     | Prism Framework                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| MVVM                  | Yes, lightweight, source-generated        | Yes, full-featured                              |

| UI Helpers / Controls | Yes, includes helpers, converters, controls | No, focuses on architecture                     |
| Complexity            | Low to medium                              | Medium to high                                  |
| Best Suited For       | Small/medium apps, quick development      | Large enterprise apps, modular architecture    |

### Final Thoughts

- **If you want a full framework to build complex, modular apps with navigation and DI out of the box, Prism is the way to go.**
- **If you want to enhance your app with MVVM, UI helpers, and controls but prefer lighter dependencies, the .NET Community Toolkit is ideal.**

## Migration Steps
1. Audit current CommunityToolkit usages.
2. Replace with Prism equivalents (ViewModels, Commands, Navigation, etc.).
3. Refactor for Prism's modular structure.
4. Test all features and add regression tests.
