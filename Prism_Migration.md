# Migrate to Prism Toolkit

## Problem
The current project uses CommunityToolkit for MVVM, which is less suited for advanced modularity, navigation, and extensibility needs (e.g., plugins, dynamic UI, multi-platform support).

## Proposal
- Migrate the project from CommunityToolkit to Prism Toolkit.
- Use Prism's advanced features (modularity, navigation, dependency injection, region management).
- Leverage Prism's strong support for MVVM, modular UI composition, and plugin architectures.

## Benefits
- **Superior Modularity:** Prism is designed for modular applications.
- **Dynamic UI:** Supports user-editable UI and runtime composition.
- **Multi-Platform Ready:** Facilitates browser/site support and alternative frontends.
- **Plugin-Friendly:** Well-suited for extensibility.

## Migration Steps
1. Audit current CommunityToolkit usages.
2. Replace with Prism equivalents (ViewModels, Commands, Navigation, etc.).
3. Refactor for Prism's modular structure.
4. Test all features and add regression tests.
