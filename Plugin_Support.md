# Feature: Plugin Support Architecture

## Problem
The current architecture does not easily allow for third-party plugins or extensions, limiting the ability to add new features (e.g., alternative VCS, UI components, integrations).

## Proposal
- Design and implement a plugin system (e.g., using MEF, Prism modules, or a custom loader).
- Define clear extension points and APIs for plugins.
- Document plugin development and loading process.

## Benefits
- **Extensibility:** Users and developers can add new features without modifying core code.
- **Community Growth:** Encourages external contributions and ecosystem development.
- **Future Features:** Enables easy addition of new VCS support, UI widgets, workflows, etc.

## Steps
1. Research plugin architectures in .NET and Prism.
2. Define plugin contracts and APIs.
3. Implement plugin discovery and loading.
4. Provide documentation and sample plugins.
