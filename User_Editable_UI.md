# Feature: User-Editable UI (AXAML)

## Problem
Users currently cannot easily modify or customize the UI. Enabling user-editable UI (e.g., via AXAML or similar) would greatly increase flexibility and user empowerment.

## Practical Considerations

While editing AXAML (Avalonia XAML) files can be challenging for non-technical users, a well-designed customization system can make the process safe and approachable:

- **Safety:** If implemented correctly, user edits cannot break the application in a critical way. The system can validate and sandbox changes, ensuring stability.
- **Community Sharing:** Users can benefit from AXAML files or templates provided by more experienced community members, allowing easy adoption of new layouts or styles. Some proffesionals also could provide signed authored axaml files or in form of plugins. And signing them and switching them in the app may benefit from some features from Prism framework, as it famous for plugin support.   
- **Intuitive Customization:** Even if users do not understand the full AXAML syntax, we can expose simple, valuable customization points (such as colors, labels, or layout options) with clear comments and documentation. This enables users to tweak small aspects of the UI without deep technical knowledge.
- **Not Critical, But Valuable:** While full AXAML editing is not a critical feature for the project right now, enabling some level of safe and documented customization—even if limited—can empower users and foster a more engaged community.

AXAML is declarative and pretty intuitive for some changes .
By focusing on simple, well-commented customization areas, we can make the UI flexible for power users and accessible for beginners, without sacrificing reliability.

## Theming, Color Customization, and Plugin Support

Changing colors, fonts, and other visual properties is a common and intuitive way to let users personalize their experience. This can be implemented as:

- **Themes:** Provide several pre-defined or user-editable AXAML theme files that control colors, fonts, and styles. Users can switch between themes or tweak them to their liking.
- **Theme Plugins:** For more advanced users or scenarios, allow themes to be loaded as plugins, enabling even more flexibility and community sharing.
- **Prism Framework Advantage:** Migrating to the Prism framework is especially beneficial here. Prism's modularity and region management make it easier to implement theme/plugin systems and support runtime switching or extension of UI elements. This also lays the groundwork for broader plugin support in the future, making the application more extensible and adaptable.

By enabling both simple theme switching and more advanced plugin-based customization, we can cater to a wide range of user needs—from basic personalization to deep UI extension.

## Proposal
- Integrate support for user-editable UI definitions (e.g., AXAML, Avalonia XAML, or JSON-based UI schemas).
- Provide a UI editor or documentation for editing AXAML layouts.
- Ensure changes are hot-reloadable and sandboxed for safety.

## Benefits
- **User Empowerment:** Users can tailor the UI to their workflows.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Developers and users can experiment with UI changes quickly.
- **Community Sharing:** Users can share custom layouts and themes.

## Steps
1. Research AXAML (Avalonia XAML) runtime editing and loading in Avalonia/Prism.
2. Implement user-editable AXAML loading and validation.
3. Provide documentation and/or an in-app helpers for editing AXAML.
