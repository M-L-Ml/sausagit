# Feature: User-Editable UI (AXAML)

## Problem
Users currently cannot easily modify or customize the UI. Enabling user-editable UI (e.g., via AXAML or similar) would greatly increase flexibility and user empowerment.

## Proposal
- Integrate support for user-editable UI definitions (e.g., AXAML, Avalonia XAML, or JSON-based UI schemas).
- Provide a UI editor or documentation for editing AXAML layouts.
- Ensure changes are hot-reloadable and sandboxed for safety.

## Benefits
- **User Empowerment:** Users can tailor the UI to their workflows.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Developers and users can experiment with UI changes quickly.
- **Community Sharing:** Users can share custom layouts and themes.

## Steps
1. Research AXAML (Avalonia XAML) runtime editing and loading in Avalonia/Prism.
2. Implement user-editable AXAML loading and validation.
3. Provide documentation and/or an in-app editor for AXAML.
