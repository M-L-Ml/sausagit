# Feature: User-Editable UI (AXAML)

## Problem
Users currently cannot easily modify or customize the UI. Enabling user-editable UI (e.g., via AXAML or similar) would greatly increase flexibility and user empowerment.

## Practical Considerations

While editing AXAML (Avalonia XAML) files can be challenging for non-technical users, a well-designed customization system can make the process safe and approachable:

- **Safety:** If implemented correctly, user edits cannot break the application in a critical way. The system can validate and sandbox changes, ensuring stability.
- **Community Sharing:** Users can benefit from AXAML files or templates provided by more experienced community members, allowing easy adoption of new layouts or styles.
- **Intuitive Customization:** Even if users do not understand the full AXAML syntax, we can expose simple, valuable customization points (such as colors, labels, or layout options) with clear comments and documentation. This enables users to tweak small aspects of the UI without deep technical knowledge.
- **Not Critical, But Valuable:** While full AXAML editing is not a critical feature for the project right now, enabling some level of safe and documented customization—even if limited—can empower users and foster a more engaged community.

By focusing on simple, well-commented customization areas, we can make the UI flexible for power users and accessible for beginners, without sacrificing reliability.

## Proposal
- Integrate support for user-editable UI definitions (e.g., AXAML, Avalonia XAML, or JSON-based UI schemas).
- Provide a UI editor or documentation for editing AXAML layouts.
- Ensure changes are hot-reloadable and sandboxed for safety.

## Benefits
- **User Empowerment:** Users can tailor the UI to their workflows.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Developers and users can experiment with UI changes quickly.
- **Community Sharing:** Users can share custom layouts and themes.

## Steps
1. Research AXAML (Avalonia XAML) runtime editing and loading in Avalonia/Prism.
2. Implement user-editable AXAML loading and validation.
3. Provide documentation and/or an in-app editor for AXAML.
