# Feature: User-Editable UI (AXAML)

## Problem
Currently, users cannot easily customize the UI. Allowing edits to AXAML (Avalonia XAML) would increase flexibility and user empowerment.

## Practical Considerations

- **Safety:** Validation and sandboxing can prevent user changes from breaking the app.
- **Community Sharing:** Users can use AXAML templates or plugins from trusted sources. Prism can help manage and switch these resources, though Avalonia supports dynamic AXAML switching natively.
- **Intuitive Customization:** Simple, well-commented customization points (e.g., colors, labels, layout) can make tweaks accessible to non-experts.
- **Not Critical, But Valuable:** While not essential, limited, documented customization can boost engagement and make the app feel more personal.

## Theming and Plugins
- **Themes:** Users can switch between or edit AXAML theme files to change colors and styles.
- **Theme Plugins:** Advanced users can load themes as plugins for deeper customization.
- **Prism:**  Useful for plugin management and modularity, but not strictly required for dynamic AXAML switching. See migration to Prism proposal.

## Proposal
- Support user-editable AXAML and/or alternative UI schemas.
- Provide clear documentation and hints for editing.
- Enable hot-reloading of UI changes, with safety checks.
- Add disclaimers about user-modified interfaces.

## Benefits
- **Empowerment:** Users can tailor the UI.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Easy experimentation.
- **Community:** Sharing of layouts and themes.

## Steps
1. Research runtime AXAML editing/loading in Avalonia/Prism.
2. Implement user-editable AXAML loading and validation.
3. Provide documentation or in-app helpers.
