# Prism License Clarification

## Concern
Prism is licensed under the Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL), not MIT. There is concern about using Prism in an open-source, non-profit project.

## Clarification
- **Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL):** Prism uses the Ms-PL, which is an OSI-approved open-source license.
- **Allowed Uses:** You can use, modify, distribute, and even commercialize software built with Prism, as long as you include the original license and copyright.
- **No Copyleft:** Ms-PL does not require your code to be open-source, nor does it impose viral requirements.
- **Attribution:** You must not use the authors’ names to endorse your product.

## Why You Should Not Worry
- **Open Source:** Your project is open-source and non-profit, so you fully comply with Ms-PL requirements.
- **No Commercial Restriction:** Ms-PL allows both personal and commercial use.
- **Large Ecosystem:** Many successful open-source projects use Ms-PL-licensed dependencies.

## Requirements
- Include the Ms-PL license text in your distribution.
- Do not use the authors’ names to promote your project.
