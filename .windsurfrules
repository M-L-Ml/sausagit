# Rules for AI

- When copying or porting code from original SourceGit source code file, always include a comment with the original file path and fully qualified class name. This attribution must be preserved through all code transformations.
- Upon receiving the prompt "Act as [file name]" or "Follow [file name]", always start with reading that file and following its instructions.
- If prompted to capture knowledge or rules or whatever like this, update the "# Agent Knowledge" section in the followed process md file. If the section does not exist, append the information at the end of the file.
