# Refactor: Modularize the Project

## Problem
The current codebase is monolithic, making it difficult to maintain, test, and extend. As the project grows, this structure limits flexibility and increases technical debt.

## Proposal
- Split the codebase into several projects/libraries (e.g., Core Logic, UI, Plugins, Data Access, VCS Integrations).
- Clearly define interfaces and contracts between modules.
- Ensure each module is independently testable and reusable.

## Benefits
- **Improved Testability:** Smaller, focused modules are easier to unit test.
- **Better Maintainability:** Isolated changes reduce risk of regressions.
- **Enhanced Extensibility:** New features (e.g., plugin support, alternate UIs) are easier to implement.
- **Future-Proofing:** Enables support for multiple frontends (desktop, browser, etc.) and VCS integrations.

## Steps
1. Identify logical boundaries in the current codebase.
2. Create separate projects for each major concern.
3. Refactor code to remove cross-project dependencies.
4. Add automated tests for each module.
