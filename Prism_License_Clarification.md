# Prism License Clarification

## Concern
Prism is licensed under the MIT license, which is slightly more restrictive than the CommunityToolkit license. There is concern about using Prism in an open-source, non-profit project.

## Clarification
- **MIT License:** Prism uses the MIT license, which is highly permissive and widely used in open-source projects.
- **Allowed Uses:** You can use, modify, distribute, and even commercialize software built with Prism, as long as you include the original license and copyright.
- **No Copyleft:** Unlike GPL, MIT does not require your code to be open-source.
- **CommunityToolkit:** Uses the MIT license as well, so there is no practical restriction difference for open-source, non-profit projects.

## Why You Should Not Worry
- **Open Source:** Your project is open-source and non-profit, so you fully comply with MIT requirements.
- **No Commercial Restriction:** MIT allows both personal and commercial use.
- **Large Ecosystem:** Many successful open-source projects use MIT-licensed dependencies.
